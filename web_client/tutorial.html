<h2>Get Started !</h2>
<p>
    scholarScape is designed to make your life easy when dealing with Google Scholar.
    It enables you to launch crawling campaigns on a particular word, a particular author
    or a particular URL (you can put several separated by break lines). scholarScape will then :
    <ul > 
        <li>store all the publications on this page</li>
        <li>click on all the cited by "links" and fetch all the publications on those pages too</li>
        <li>and again until a certain depth has been reached</li>
    </ul>
    An image is worth a thousand word :<br/>
    <img src="" alt="img" title="img"/>
</p>
<h3>Organisation</h3>
<p>
The are two main pages in scholarScape : <em>launch</em> and <em>explore</em>.
</p>
<p>
The launch section is where you launch your crawling campaigns.
You only have to fill in the project your campaign will belong to, your campaign
name, the start titles/authors/urls, the depth of the crawl and the download_delay.
